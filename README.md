# socket_programming
This is a socket programming project that features TCP and UDP connections

## What are we doing?

In this project we have created two server and two client files. We have UDP and TCP connections when it comes to socket programming. You can read up on socket prgramming on [Socket_programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-python/).  
The server side has all the processes, such as calculating the fastest and shortest route using the weights, route reports (pothholes, traffic, etc). Then on the cient side we have the routes to be travelled, and generally what the user might see, which in my world is called frontend/user-interface
